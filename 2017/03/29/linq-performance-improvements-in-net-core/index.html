		</header><div class="content post__content clearfix">
			<p>By now, you&rsquo;re probably aware that Microsoft released an open-source and cross-platform version of the .NET platform: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx">.NET Core</a>. This means you can now build and run .NET apps on Linux or macOS. This is pretty cool in itself, but it doesn&rsquo;t end there: .NET Core also brings a lot of improvements to the Base Class Library.</p>
<p>For instance, Linq has been made faster in .NET Core. I made a little benchmark to compare the performance of some common Linq methods, and the results are quite impressive:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The full code for the benchmark can be found <a href="https://github.com/thomaslevesque/TestLinqPerf">here</a>. As with all microbenchmarks, it has to be taken with a grain of salt, but it gives an idea of the improvements.</p>
<p>Some lines in this table are quite surprising. How can <code>Select</code> run 5000 times almost instantly? First, we have to keep in mind that most Linq operators are lazy: they don&rsquo;t actually do anything until you enumerate the result, so doing something like <code>array.Select(i =&gt; i * i)</code> executes in constant time (it just returns a lazy sequence, without consuming the items in <code>array</code>). This is why I included a call to <code>Count()</code> in my benchmark, to make sure the result is enumerated.</p>
<p>Despite this, it runs 5000 times in 413Âµs&hellip; This is possible due to an optimization in the .NET Core implementation of <code>Select</code> and <code>Count</code>. A useful property of <code>Select</code> is that it produces a sequence with the same number of items as the source sequence. In .NET Core, <code>Select</code> takes advantage of this. If the source is an <code>ICollection&lt;T&gt;</code> or an array, it returns a custom enumerable object that keeps track of the number of items. <code>Count</code> can then just retrieve this value and return it, which produces a result in constant time. The full .NET Framework implementation, on the other hand, naively enumerates the sequence produced by <code>Select</code>, which takes much longer.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that in this situation, .NET Core will <em>not</em> execute the projection specified in <code>Select</code>, so it&rsquo;s a breaking change compared to the desktop framework for code that was relying on side effects of this projection. This has been identified as an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/14435">issue</a> which has already been fixed on the master branch, so the next release of .NET Core <em>will</em> execute the projection on each item.</p>
<p><code>OrderBy</code> followed by <code>Count()</code> also runs almost instantly&hellip; did Microsoft invent a <code>O(1)</code> sorting algorithm? Unfortunately, no&hellip; The explanation is the same as for <code>Select</code>: since <code>OrderBy</code> preserves the item count, the information is recorded so that it can be used by <code>Count</code>, and there is no need to actually sort the input sequence.</p>
<p>OK, so these cases were pretty obvious improvements (which will be rolled back anyway, as mentioned above). What about the <code>SelectAndToArray</code> case? In this test, I call <code>ToArray()</code> on the result of <code>Select</code>, to make sure that the projection is actually performed on each item of the source sequence: no cheating this time. Still, the .NET Core version is 68% faster than the full .NET Framework version. The reason has to do with allocations: since the .NET Core implementation knows how many items are in the result of <code>Select</code>, it can directly allocate an array of the correct size. In the .NET Framework, this information is not available, so it starts with a small array, copies items into it until it&rsquo;s full, then allocates a larger array, copies the previous array into it, copies the next items from the sequence until the array is full, and so on. This causes a lot of allocations and copies, hence the degraded performance. A few years ago, I <a href="http://www.thomaslevesque.com/2014/12/07/optimize-toarray-and-tolist-by-providing-the-number-of-elements/">suggested</a> an optimized version of <code>ToList</code> and <code>ToArray</code>, where you had to specify the size. The .NET Core implementation basically does the same thing, except that you don&rsquo;t have to pass the size manually, since it&rsquo;s passed along the Linq method chain.</p>
<p><code>Where</code> and <code>WhereAndToArray</code> are both about 8% faster on .NET Core 1.1. Looking at the code (<a href="https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Core/System/Linq/Enumerable.cs,ed14299f42af7eb2">.NET 4.6.2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/e5cba5572d5b3634e768e3df3ddb5399fcf969b1/src/System.Linq/src/System/Linq/Where.cs#L208">.NET Core</a>), I can&rsquo;t see any obvious difference that could explain the better performance, so I suspect it&rsquo;s mostly due to improvements in the runtime. In this case, <code>ToArray</code> doesn&rsquo;t know the length of the input sequence, since there is no way to predict how many items <code>Where</code> will yield, so it can&rsquo;t use the same optimization as with <code>Select</code> and has to build the array the slow way.</p>
<p>We already discussed <code>OrderBy</code> + <code>Count()</code>, which wasn&rsquo;t a fair comparison since the .NET Core implementation didn&rsquo;t actually sort the sequence. The <code>OrderByAndToArray</code> case is more interesting, because the sort can&rsquo;t be skipped. And in this case, the .NET Core implementation is slightly <em>slower</em> than the .NET 4.6.2 one. I&rsquo;m not sure why this is; again, the implementation is very similar, although there has been a bit of refactoring in .NET Core.</p>
<p>So, on the whole, Linq seems generally faster in .NET Core than in .NET 4.6.2, which is very good news. Of course, I only benchmarked a limited numbers of scenarios, but it shows the .NET Core team is working hard to optimize everything they can.</p>
