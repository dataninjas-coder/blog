      ASP.NET Core SignalR is a super easy way to establish two-way communication between an ASP.NET Core app and its clients, using WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or long polling, depending on the client&rsquo;s capabilities. For instance, it can be used to send a notification to all connected clients. However, if you scale out your application to multiple server instances, it no longer works out of the box: only the clients connected to the instance that sent the notification will receive it.

      A few months ago, Google decided to shutdown Google+, due to multiple data leaks. More recently, they announced that the Google+ APIs will be shutdown on March 7, 2019, which is pretty soon! In fact, calls to these APIs might start to fail as soon as January 28, which is less than 3 weeks from now. You might think that it doesn&rsquo;t affect you as a developer; but if you&rsquo;re using Google authentication in an ASP.

      If you use Azure AD authentication and want to allow users from any tenant to connect to your ASP.NET Core application, you need to configure the Azure AD app as multi-tenant, and use a &ldquo;wildcard&rdquo; tenant id such as organizations or common in the authority URL:
openIdConnectOptions.Authority = &#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/organizations/v2.0&#34;; The problem when you do that is that with the default configuration, the token validation will fail because the issuer in the token won&rsquo;t match the issuer specified in the OpenID metadata.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Initialization in ASP.NET Core is a bit awkward. There are well defined places for registering services (the Startup.ConfigureServices method) and for building the middleware pipeline (the Startup.Configure method), but not for performing other initialization steps (e.g. pre-loading data, seeding a database, etc.).
Using a middleware: not such a good idea Two months ago I published a blog post about asynchronous initialization of an ASP.NET Core app using a custom middleware. At the time I was rather pleased with my solution, but a comment from Frantisek made me realize it wasn&rsquo;t such a good approach.

Sometimes you need to perform some initialization steps when your web application starts. However, putting such code in the Startup.Configure method is generally not a good idea, because:
 There&rsquo;s no current scope in the Configure method, so you can&rsquo;t use services registered with &ldquo;scoped&rdquo; lifetime (this would throw an InvalidOperationException: Cannot resolve scoped service &lsquo;MyApp.

      If you&rsquo;ve been following the news about .NET, you probably know that the upcoming version 4.0 of C# introduces a new dynamic type. This type allows to access members of an object which are not statically known (at compile time). These members will be resolved at runtime, thanks to the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime). This feature makes it easier to manipulate COM objects, or any object which type is not statically known.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Async code is a great way to keep your app’s UI responsive. You can start an async operation from the UI thread, await it without blocking the UI thread, and naturally resume on the UI thread when it’s done. This is a very powerful feature, and most of the time you don’t even need to think about it; it “just works”. However, this works only if the async operation is started from a thread that has a synchronization context (such as the UI thread in Windows Forms, WPF or WinRT).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The .NET framework comes with a number of low-level synchronization primitives. The most commonly used are collectively known as “wait handles”, and inherit the WaitHandle class: Semaphore, Mutex, AutoResetEvent and ManualResetEvent. These classes have been there since at least .NET 2.0 (1.1 for some of them), but they haven’t evolved much since they were introduced, which means they don’t support common features that were introduced later. In particular, they don’t provide support for waiting asynchronously, nor do they support cancelling the wait.

      If you ever had to upload large volumes of data over HTTP, you probably ran into timeout issues. The default Timeout value for HttpWebRequest is 100 seconds, which means that if it takes more than that from the time you send the request headers to the time you receive the response headers, your request will fail. Obviously, if you’re uploading a large file, you need to increase that timeout… but to which value?

Obviously you will need the key to decrypt the password, so it needs to be either in the executable or in the configuration.

The trouble with the recursive approach is that it can use a lot of space on the stack: when you reach a certain recursion depth, the memory allocated for the thread stack runs out, and you get a stack overflow error that usually terminates the process (StackOverflowException in .

      As you probably know, incorrect usage of events is one of the main causes for memory leaks in .NET applications : an event keeps references to its listener objects (through a delegate), which prevents the garbage collector from collecting them when they&rsquo;re not used anymore. This is especially true of static events, because the references are kept for all the lifetime of the application. If the application often adds handlers to the event and never removes them, the memory usage will grow as long as the application runs, until no more memory is available.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      If you&rsquo;ve been following the news about .NET, you probably know that the upcoming version 4.0 of C# introduces a new dynamic type. This type allows to access members of an object which are not statically known (at compile time). These members will be resolved at runtime, thanks to the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime). This feature makes it easier to manipulate COM objects, or any object which type is not statically known.

      A few months ago, I wrote a post where I explained how to automatically sort a GridView when a column header is clicked. I had mentioned a possible improvement : add a sort glyph in the column header to show which column is sorted. In today&rsquo;s post, I present a new version of the GridViewSort class, which displays the sort glyph. To achieve this result, I used an Adorner : this is a component which allows to draw over existing UI elements, on an independant rendering layer.

      Today I&rsquo;d like to present an idea that occurred to me recently. Nothing about WPF this time, this is all about C# class design ! The problem It&rsquo;s very common in C# programs to have an object that owns a collection of child items with a reference to their parent. For instance, this is the case for Windows Forms controls, which have a collection of child controls (Controls), and a reference to their parent control (Parent).

      It&rsquo;s quite simple, in WPF, to present data in a grid, thanks to the GridView class.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      If you develop WPF applications according to the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, you may have faced this issue : in XAML, how to bind a key or mouse gesture to a ViewModel command ? The obvious and intuitive approach would be this one :
&lt;UserControl.InputBindings&gt; &lt;KeyBinding Modifiers=&#34;Control&#34; Key=&#34;E&#34; Command=&#34;{Binding EditCommand}&#34;/&gt; &lt;/UserControl.InputBindings&gt; Unfortunately, this code doesn&rsquo;t work, for two reasons :
 The Command property is not a dependency property, so you cannot assign it through binding InputBindings are not part of the logical or visual tree of the control, so they don&rsquo;t inherit the DataContext  A solution would be to create the InputBindings in the code-behind, but in the MVVM pattern we usually prefer to avoid this&hellip; I spent a long time looking for alternative solutions to do this in XAML, but most of them are quite complex and unintuitive.

      SQLite is a nice in-process database engine: it’s very lightweight, doesn’t require any server or configuration, and runs on all platforms. There is even an official ADO.NET provider that’s very well made. However, if you store dates as UTC with this provider, you will probably encounter a serious issue: even though the date is properly stored as UTC (it’s stored in a form similar to ISO8601, with a ‘Z’ to indicate the UTC timezone), when you read it back from the database, you will get a DateTime converted to local time, with Kind = Unspecified.

      A few years ago, I blogged about a generic implementation of the weak event pattern in C#. The goal was to mitigate the memory leaks associated with events when you forget to unsubscribe. The implementation was based on the use of weak references to the subscribers, to allow them to be garbage collected.
My initial solution was more a proof of concept than anything else, and had a major performance issue, due to the use of DynamicInvoke every time the event was raised.

At some point I realized it was very impractical, so I published the code on CodePlex (it has now moved to GitHub) under the name WpfAnimatedGif, and started maintaining it there.

      If you write an application that has anything to do with file management, you will probably need to display the size of the files. But if a file has a size of 123456789 bytes, it doesn’t mean that you should just display this value to the user, because it’s hard to read, and the user usually doesn’t need 1-byte precision. Instead, you will write something like 118 MB.
This should be a no-brainer, but there are actually a number of different ways to display byte sizes… For instance, there are several co-existing conventions for units and prefixes:

      A common requirement for desktop applications is to handle system-wide hotkeys, in order to intercept keyboard shortcuts even when they don’t have focus. Unfortunately, there is no built-in feature in the .NET framework to do it.
Of course, this is not a new issue, and there are quite a few open-source libraries that address it (e.g. VirtualInput). Most of them rely on a global system hook, which allow them to intercept all keystrokes, even the ones you’re not interested in.

      Async code is a great way to keep your app’s UI responsive. You can start an async operation from the UI thread, await it without blocking the UI thread, and naturally resume on the UI thread when it’s done. This is a very powerful feature, and most of the time you don’t even need to think about it; it “just works”. However, this works only if the async operation is started from a thread that has a synchronization context (such as the UI thread in Windows Forms, WPF or WinRT).

      Asynchrony in C# 5 is awesome, and I’ve been using it a lot since it was introduced. But there are few annoying limitations; for instance, you cannot pass parameters by reference (ref or out) to an asynchronous method. There are good reasons for that; the most obvious is that if you pass a local variable by reference, it is stored on the stack, but the current stack won’t remain available during the whole execution of the async method (only until the first await), so the location of the variable won’t exist anymore.

        Tackling timeout issues when uploading large files with HttpWebRequest

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      If you ever had to upload large volumes of data over HTTP, you probably ran into timeout issues. The default Timeout value for HttpWebRequest is 100 seconds, which means that if it takes more than that from the time you send the request headers to the time you receive the response headers, your request will fail. Obviously, if you’re uploading a large file, you need to increase that timeout… but to which value?

      Today I’d like to share a trick I used while developing my first Windows Store application. I’m very new to this technology and it’s my first article about it, so I hope I won’t make a fool of myself…
It’s often useful to be notified when the value of a dependency property changes; many controls expose events for that purpose, but it’s not always the case. For instance, recently I was trying to detect when the Content property of a ContentControl changed.

      Caller info attributes are one of the new features of C# 5. They&rsquo;re attributes applied to optional method parameters that enable you to pass caller information implicitly to a method. I&rsquo;m not sure that description is very clear, so an example will help you understand:
static void Log( string message, [CallerMemberName] string memberName = null, [CallerFilePath] string filePath = null, [CallerLineNumber] int lineNumber = 0) { Console.WriteLine( &#34;[{0:g} - {1} - {2} - line {3}] {4}&#34;, DateTime.

      Today I&rsquo;d like to share a trick that I used quite often in the past few months.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The DataContext property in WPF is extremely handy, because it is automatically inherited by all children of the element where you assign it; therefore you don&rsquo;t need to set it again on each element you want to bind. However, in some cases the DataContext is not accessible: it happens for elements that are not part of the visual or logical tree. It can be very difficult then to bind a property on those elements&hellip; Let&rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example: we want to display a list of products in a DataGrid.

      I recently started using Visual Studio Online for personal projects, and I must say it’s a pretty good platform, although it would be nice to be able to host public projects as well as private ones. The thing I like the most is the integration with Visual Studio Team Explorer to manage work items and builds.
However, I noticed a little gotcha when using Git for source control : the remote for VS Online must be named origin, otherwise Team Explorer won’t detect that it’s a VS Online project, and it won’t show the “Builds” and “Work items” pages.

      As far as I can remember, Visual Studio always had something called “custom tools”, also known as single-file generators. When you apply such a tool to a file in your project, it will generate something (typically code, but not necessarily) based on the content of the file. For instance, the default custom tool for resource files is called ResXFileCodeGenerator, and generates a class that provides easy access to the resources defined in the resx file.

A circular dependency is when some components depend on each other, directly or indirectly, e.g. A depends on B which depends on C which depends on A:

      Out of the box, ASP.NET Core has the concept of &ldquo;environments&rdquo;, which allows your app to use different settings based on which environment it&rsquo;s running in. For instance, you can have Development/Staging/Production environments, each with its own settings file, and a common settings file shared by all environments:
 appsettings.json: global settings appsettings.Development.json: settings specific to the Development environment appsettings.Staging.json: settings specific to the Staging environment appsettings.Production.json: settings specific to the Production environment  With the default configuration, environment-specific settings just override global settings, so you don&rsquo;t have to specify unchanged settings in every environment if they&rsquo;re already specified in the global settings file.

for and foreach loops are among the most useful constructs in a C# developer&rsquo;s toolbox. To iterate a collection, foreach is, in my opinion, more convenient than for in most cases. It works with all collection types, including those that are not indexable such as IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;, and doesn&rsquo;t require to access the current element by its index.
But sometimes, you do need the index of the current item; this usually leads to one of these patterns:

      Middlewhat? The ASP.NET Core architecture features a system of middleware, which are pieces of code that handle requests and responses. Middleware are chained to each other to form a pipeline. Incoming requests are passed through the pipeline, where each middleware has a chance to do something with them before passing them to the next middleware. Outgoing responses are also passed through the pipeline, in reverse order. If this sounds very abstract, the following schema from the official ASP.

        Cleanup Git history to remove unwanted files

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I recently had to work with a Git repository whose modifications needed to be ported to another repo. Unfortunately, the repo had been created without a .gitignore file, so a lot of useless files (bin/obj/packages directories&hellip;) had been commited. This made the history hard to follow, because each commit had hundreds of modified files.
Fortunately, it&rsquo;s rather easy with Git to cleanup a branch, by recreating the same commits without the files that shouldn&rsquo;t have been there in the first place.

      The problem If you often use HttpClient to call REST APIs or to transfer files, you may have been annoyed by the way this class handles request timeout. There are two major issues with timeout handling in HttpClient:
 The timeout is defined at the HttpClient level and applies to all requests made with this HttpClient; it would be more convenient to be able to specify a timeout individually for each request.

      T4 (Text Template Transformation Toolkit) is a great tool to generate code at design time; you can, for instance, create POCO classes from database tables, generate repetitive code, etc. In Visual Studio, T4 files (.tt extension) are associated with the TextTemplatingFileGenerator custom tool, which transforms the template to generate an output file every time you save the template. But sometimes it&rsquo;s not enough, and you want to ensure that the template&rsquo;s output is regenerated before build.

      To be honest, I never really liked MSBuild until recently. The project files generated by Visual Studio were a mess, most of their content was redundant, you had to unload the projects to edit them, it was poorly documented&hellip; But with the advent of .NET Core and the new &ldquo;SDK-style&rdquo; projects, it&rsquo;s become much, much better.
MSBuild 15 introduced a pretty cool feature: implicit imports (I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the official name, but I&rsquo;ll use it anyway).

      By now, you&rsquo;re probably aware that Microsoft released an open-source and cross-platform version of the .NET platform: .NET Core. This means you can now build and run .NET apps on Linux or macOS. This is pretty cool in itself, but it doesn&rsquo;t end there: .NET Core also brings a lot of improvements to the Base Class Library.
For instance, Linq has been made faster in .NET Core. I made a little benchmark to compare the performance of some common Linq methods, and the results are quite impressive:

It&rsquo;s a very elegant and easy to use library to create text parsers, using parser combinators, which are a very common technique in functional programming. The theorical concept may seem a bit scary, but as you&rsquo;ll see in a minute, Sprache makes it very simple.

      A few years ago, Microsoft introduced the HttpClient class as a modern alternative to HttpWebRequest to make web requests from .NET apps. Not only is this new API much easier to use, cleaner, and asynchronous by design, it&rsquo;s also easily extensible.
You might have noticed that HttpClient has a constructor that accepts a HttpMessageHandler. What is this handler? It&rsquo;s an object that accepts a request (HttpRequestMessage) and returns a response (HttpResponseMessage); how it does that is entirely dependent on the implementation.

  emitting metadata for the names of tuple elements, so that the names are preserved across assemblies
  deconstruction of tuples into separate variables

      A tuple is an finite ordered list of values, of possibly different types, which is used to bundle related values together without having to create a specific type to hold them.
In .NET 4.0, a set of Tuple classes has been introduced in the framework, which can be used as follows:
private static Tuple&lt;int, double&gt; Tally(IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; values) { int count = 0; double sum = 0.0; foreach (var value in values) { count++; sum += value; } return Tuple.

      Async programming in C# used to be hard; thanks to .NET 4’s Task Parallel Library and C# 5’s async/await feature, it has become fairly easy, and as a result, is becoming much more common. At the same time, a standardized approach to cancellation has been introduced : cancellation tokens. The basic idea is that you create a CancellationTokenSource that controls the cancellation, and pass the token it provides to the method that you want to be able to cancel.

      Exception filters are one of the major new features of C# 6. They take advantage of a CLR feature that was there from the start, but wasn’t used in C# until now. They allow you to specify a condition on a catch block:
static void Main(){try{Foo.DoSomethingThatMightFail(null);}catch (MyException ex) when (ex.Code == 42){Console.WriteLine(&quot;Error 42 occurred&quot;);}}As you might expect, the catch block will be entered if and only if ex.

      The ToArray and ToList extension methods are convenient ways to eagerly materialize an enumerable sequence (e.g. a Linq query) into an array or a list. However, there’s something that bothers me: both of these methods are very inefficient if they don’t know the number of elements in the sequence (which is almost always the case when you use them on a Linq query). Let’s focus on ToArray for now (ToList has a few differences, but the principle is mostly the same).

      When unit testing a method, one of the things to test is argument validation : for instance, ensure that the method throws a ArgumentNullException when a null argument is passed for a parameter that isn’t allowed to be null. Writing this kind of test is very easy, but it’s also a tedious and repetitive task, especially if the method has many parameters… So I wrote a method that automates part of this task: it tries to pass null for each of the specified arguments, and asserts that the method throws an ArgumentNullException.

      If you have used the HttpWebRequest class to upload data, you know that it uses a “push” model. What I mean is that you call the GetRequestStream method, which opens the connection if necessary, sends the headers, and returns a stream on which you can write directly.
.NET 4.5 introduced the HttpClient class as a new way to communicate over HTTP. It actually relies on HttpWebRequest under the hood, but offers a more convenient and fully asynchronous API.

When you write unit tests for a class that takes dependencies, you typically need to create fake/mock dependencies and manually inject them into the SUT (System Under Test), or use a DI container to register the fake dependencies and construct the SUT. This is a bit tedious, and a few months ago I came up with an auto-mocking Unity extension to make it easier.

      Unit testing can be tedious sometimes, especially when testing classes that have complex dependencies. Fortunately, some tools make it somewhat easier. I’ve been using FakeItEasy a lot recently; it’s a very easy to use mocking framework for .NET. It has a very lean and simple API based on generics and lambda expressions, and is a real pleasure to work with. It came as a breath of fresh air compared to the old RhinoMocks I had been using before.

      Recently, my team and I started writing unit tests on an application that uses a lot of async code. We used NUnit (2.6) because we were already familiar with it, but we had never tried it on async code yet.
Let’s assume the system under test is this very interesting Calculator class:

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Here&rsquo;s a piece of code I wrote a while ago, I just thought it could be useful for WinForms developers&hellip; In WPF, there is a very handy method to move a window with no borders : Window.DragMove. It can be used like that :
private void Window_MouseDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { this.DragMove(); } When you call this method, the window is moved with the mouse until the button is released. It could hardly be simpler ;) Unfortunately, this method only exists in WPF, and a majority of developers are still working with Windows Forms.

      As you probably know, the standard way to select or deselect an item in a WinRT list control is to slide it up or down a little. Although I rather like this gesture, it’s not very intuitive for users unfamiliar with Modern UI. And it gets even more confusing, because my previous statement wasn’t perfectly accurate: in fact, you have to slide the item perpendicularly to the panning direction. In a GridView, which (by default) pans horizontally, that means up or down; but in a ListView, which pans vertically, you have to slide the item left or right.

      Windows 8 provides an API for showing toast notifications. Unfortunately, it’s very cumbersome: to define the content of a notification, you must use a predefined template that is provided in the form of an XmlDocument, and set the value for each field in the XML. There is nothing in the API to let you know which fields the template defines, you need to check the toast template catalog in the documentation.

It’s often useful to be notified when the value of a dependency property changes; many controls expose events for that purpose, but it’s not always the case. For instance, recently I was trying to detect when the Content property of a ContentControl changed.

      Ever since the first stable release of the .NET Core SDK, we&rsquo;ve enjoyed a better C# project format, often called &ldquo;SDK-style&rdquo; because you specify a SDK to use in the project file. It&rsquo;s still a .csproj XML file, it&rsquo;s still based on MSBuild, but it&rsquo;s much more lightweight and much easier to edit by hand. Personally, I love it and use it everywhere I can.
However, out of the box, it&rsquo;s only usable for some project types: ASP.

      WPF’s RichTextBox control is quite powerful, and very handy if you need to accept rich text input. However, one of its features can become an issue: the user can paste an image. Depending on what you intend to do with the text entered by the user, you might not want that.
When I googled for a way to prevent that, the only solutions I found suggested to intercept the Ctrl-V keystroke, and swallow the event if the clipboard contains an image.

The feature I&rsquo;m going to discuss here is perhaps not the most impressive, but it fills in a gap of the previous versions: the support of markup extensions for events. Until now, it was possible to use a markup extension in XAML to assign a value to a property, but we couldn&rsquo;t do the same to subscribe to an event.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The DataContext property in WPF is extremely handy, because it is automatically inherited by all children of the element where you assign it; therefore you don&rsquo;t need to set it again on each element you want to bind. However, in some cases the DataContext is not accessible: it happens for elements that are not part of the visual or logical tree. It can be very difficult then to bind a property on those elements&hellip; Let&rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example: we want to display a list of products in a DataGrid.

      The Grid control is one of the most frequently used containers in WPF. It allows to layout elements easily in rows and columns. Unfortunately the code to declare it, while simple to write, is made quite awkward by the use of the property element syntax:

      THE feature that was missing from WPF ! Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 has been released last week, and it brings to WPF a long awaited feature : support for bindings in InputBindings. As a reminder, the issue in previous releases was that the Command property of the InputBinding class wasn&rsquo;t a DependencyProperty, so it wasn&rsquo;t possible to bind it. Furthermore, InputBindings didn&rsquo;t inherit the parent DataContext, which made it difficult to provide alternative implementations&hellip; Until now, in order to bind the Command of a KeyBinding or MouseBinding to a property of the DataContext, we had to resort to clumsy workarounds&hellip; I had eventually came up with an acceptable solution, described in this post, but I wasn&rsquo;t really satisfied with it (it used reflection on private members, and had annoying limitations).

        [WPF] Using InputBindings with the MVVM pattern

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      If you develop WPF applications according to the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, you may have faced this issue : in XAML, how to bind a key or mouse gesture to a ViewModel command ? The obvious and intuitive approach would be this one :
&lt;UserControl.InputBindings&gt; &lt;KeyBinding Modifiers=&#34;Control&#34; Key=&#34;E&#34; Command=&#34;{Binding EditCommand}&#34;/&gt; &lt;/UserControl.InputBindings&gt; Unfortunately, this code doesn&rsquo;t work, for two reasons :
 The Command property is not a dependency property, so you cannot assign it through binding InputBindings are not part of the logical or visual tree of the control, so they don&rsquo;t inherit the DataContext  A solution would be to create the InputBindings in the code-behind, but in the MVVM pattern we usually prefer to avoid this&hellip; I spent a long time looking for alternative solutions to do this in XAML, but most of them are quite complex and unintuitive.

      Soon after the release of WPF, people have been talking more and more about &ldquo;Model-View-ViewModel&rdquo; (MVVM). This expression refers to a design pattern, drawing its inspiration from the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Presentation Model (PM) patterns, and created specifically to take advantage of WPF features. This patterns enables an excellent decoupling between data, behavior and presentation, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain, and improves the collaboration between developers and designers.

      Today, I stumbled upon a very handy class : SyndicationFeed. This class, introduced in .NET 3.5, allows to manipulate syndication feeds (like RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0) with very little code. It can be used to create and publish our own feeds, or to read existing ones. For instance, here&rsquo;s how to retrieve the news feed from Google News and display its title, its hyperlink, and the titles of it&rsquo;s items :

        [WPF] Paste an image from the clipboard (bug in Clipboard.GetImage)

      Oops&hellip; 2 months already since my previous (and first) post&hellip; I really have to get on a more regular schedule ;)
If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to use the Clipboard.GetImage method in WPF, you probably had an unpleasant surprise&hellip; In fact, this method returns an InteropBitmap which, in some cases (most cases actually), can&rsquo;t be displayed in an Image control : no exception is thrown, the image size is correct, but the image either appears empty or unrecognizable.

      Hi, this is my first post on this blog, I hope you will enjoy it ;-). If you want to know a few things about me, please check out this page.
The end-user of any application expects that his preferences (window size, state of this or that option&hellip;) are saved to be restored at the next run : that&rsquo;s why .NET 2.0 introduced application settings as a unified way to persist these settings.
