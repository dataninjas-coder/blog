      <description>I&#39;ve been meaning to blog about LINQPad in a very long time. In case you don&#39;t know about it, LINQPad is a tool that lets you write and test code very quickly without having to create a full-blown project in Visual Studio. It supports C#, VB.NET, F# and SQL. It was initially intended as an educational tool to experiment with LINQ (its author, Joe Albahari, developed it as companion to his C# in a Nutshell book), but it&#39;s also extremely useful as a general-purpose .</description>

      <title>Explicitly switch to the UI thread in an async method</title>

      <description>Async code is a great way to keep your app’s UI responsive. You can start an async operation from the UI thread, await it without blocking the UI thread, and naturally resume on the UI thread when it’s done. This is a very powerful feature, and most of the time you don’t even need to think about it; it “just works”. However, this works only if the async operation is started from a thread that has a synchronization context (such as the UI thread in Windows Forms, WPF or WinRT).</description>

      <title>Passing parameters by reference to an asynchronous method</title>

      <description>Asynchrony in C# 5 is awesome, and I’ve been using it a lot since it was introduced. But there are few annoying limitations; for instance, you cannot pass parameters by reference (ref or out) to an asynchronous method. There are good reasons for that; the most obvious is that if you pass a local variable by reference, it is stored on the stack, but the current stack won’t remain available during the whole execution of the async method (only until the first await), so the location of the variable won’t exist anymore.</description>

      <title>Tackling timeout issues when uploading large files with HttpWebRequest</title>

      <description>If you ever had to upload large volumes of data over HTTP, you probably ran into timeout issues. The default Timeout value for HttpWebRequest is 100 seconds, which means that if it takes more than that from the time you send the request headers to the time you receive the response headers, your request will fail. Obviously, if you’re uploading a large file, you need to increase that timeout… but to which value?</description>

      <title>Detecting dependency property changes in WinRT</title>

      <description>Today I’d like to share a trick I used while developing my first Windows Store application. I’m very new to this technology and it’s my first article about it, so I hope I won’t make a fool of myself…
It’s often useful to be notified when the value of a dependency property changes; many controls expose events for that purpose, but it’s not always the case. For instance, recently I was trying to detect when the Content property of a ContentControl changed.</description>

      <title>Using C# 5 caller info attributes when targeting earlier versions of the .NET framework</title>

      <description>Caller info attributes are one of the new features of C# 5. They&#39;re attributes applied to optional method parameters that enable you to pass caller information implicitly to a method. I&#39;m not sure that description is very clear, so an example will help you understand:
static void Log( string message, [CallerMemberName] string memberName = null, [CallerFilePath] string filePath = null, [CallerLineNumber] int lineNumber = 0) { Console.WriteLine( &amp;#34;[{0:g} - {1} - {2} - line {3}] {4}&amp;#34;, DateTime.</description>

      <title>[WPF] Creating parameterized styles with attached properties</title>

      <description>Today I&#39;d like to share a trick that I used quite often in the past few months. Let&#39;s assume that in order to improve the look of your application, you created custom styles for the standard controls: OK, I&#39;m not a designer&amp;hellip; but it will serve the purpose well enough to illustrate my point ;). These styles are very simple, they&#39;re just the default styles of CheckBox and RadioButton in which I only changed the templates to replace the BulletChromes with these awesome blue tick marks.</description>

      <title>[WPF] How to bind to data when the DataContext is not inherited</title>
      <link>https://thomaslevesque.com/2011/03/21/wpf-how-to-bind-to-data-when-the-datacontext-is-not-inherited/</link>

      <description>The DataContext property in WPF is extremely handy, because it is automatically inherited by all children of the element where you assign it; therefore you don&#39;t need to set it again on each element you want to bind. However, in some cases the DataContext is not accessible: it happens for elements that are not part of the visual or logical tree. It can be very difficult then to bind a property on those elements&amp;hellip; Let&#39;s illustrate with a simple example: we want to display a list of products in a DataGrid.</description>

      <title>[Visual Studio] Trick : make a project item a child item of another</title>

      <description>You probably noticed that, in a C# project tree, some items are placed &amp;ldquo;under&amp;rdquo; a parent item : it is the case, for instance, for files generated by a designer or wizard : The following trick shows how to apply the same behavior to your own files. Let&#39;s assume that you want to customize the classes generated by the EDM designer. You can&#39;t modify the Model1.designer.cs file, because you changes would be overwritten by the designer.</description>
