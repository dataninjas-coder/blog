	<div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">
		A few years ago, I blogged about a generic implementation of the weak event pattern in C#. The goal was to mitigate the memory leaks associated with events when you forget to unsubscribe. The implementation was based on the use of weak references to the subscribers, to allow them to be garbage collected.
My initial solution was more a proof of concept than anything else, and had a major performance issue, due to the use of DynamicInvoke every time the event was raised.

	<div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">
		A few years ago, I wrote an article that showed how to display an animated GIF in WPF. The article included the full code, and was quite successful, since WPF had no built-in support for animated GIFs. Based on the issues reported in the comments, I made many edits to the code in the article. At some point I realized it was very impractical, so I published the code on CodePlex (it has now moved to GitHub) under the name WpfAnimatedGif, and started maintaining it there.

		If you write an application that has anything to do with file management, you will probably need to display the size of the files. But if a file has a size of 123456789 bytes, it doesn’t mean that you should just display this value to the user, because it’s hard to read, and the user usually doesn’t need 1-byte precision. Instead, you will write something like 118 MB.
This should be a no-brainer, but there are actually a number of different ways to display byte sizes… For instance, there are several co-existing conventions for units and prefixes:

		With the upcoming version 6 of C#, there’s a lot of talk on CodePlex and elsewhere about string interpolation. Not very surprising, since it’s one of the major features of that release… In case you were living under a rock during the last few months and you haven’t heard about it, string interpolation is a way to insert C# expressions inside a string, so that they’re evaluated at runtime and replaced with their values.

			[WPF] Declare global hotkeys in XAML with NHotkey

	<div class="content list__excerpt post__content clearfix">
		A common requirement for desktop applications is to handle system-wide hotkeys, in order to intercept keyboard shortcuts even when they don’t have focus. Unfortunately, there is no built-in feature in the .NET framework to do it.
Of course, this is not a new issue, and there are quite a few open-source libraries that address it (e.g. VirtualInput). Most of them rely on a global system hook, which allow them to intercept all keystrokes, even the ones you’re not interested in.
