      <description>I&#39;m currently working on a project that uses Entity Framework 4. Even though lazy loading is enabled, I often use the ObjectQuery.Include method to eagerly load associated entities, in order to avoid database roundtrips when I access them:
var query = from ord in db.Orders.Include(&amp;#34;OrderDetails&amp;#34;) where ord.Date &amp;gt;= DateTime.Today select ord; Or if I also want to eagerly load the product:
var query = from ord in db.Orders.Include(&amp;#34;OrderDetails.Product&amp;#34;) where ord.Date &amp;gt;= DateTime.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;ve been following the news about .NET, you probably know that the upcoming version 4.0 of C# introduces a new dynamic type. This type allows to access members of an object which are not statically known (at compile time). These members will be resolved at runtime, thanks to the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime). This feature makes it easier to manipulate COM objects, or any object which type is not statically known.</description>
