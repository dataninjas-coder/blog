      <description>This is the second post in a series of 2:
 Handling type hierarchies in Cosmos DB (part 1) Handling type hierarchies in Cosmos DB (part 2) (this post)  In the previous post, I talked about the difficulty of handling type hierarchies in Cosmos DB, showed that the problem was actually with the JSON serializer, and proposed a solution using JSON.NET&#39;s TypeNameHandling feature. In this post, I&#39;ll show another approach based on custom converters, and how to integrate the solution with the Cosmos DB .</description>

 Handling type hierarchies in Cosmos DB (part 1) (this post) Handling type hierarchies in Cosmos DB (part 2)  Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft&#39;s NoSQL cloud database. In Cosmos DB, you store JSON documents in containers. This makes it very easy to model data, because you don&#39;t need to split complex objects into multiple tables and use joins like in relational databases.</description>

      <description>Suppose we&#39;re writing an API for a blog. Our &amp;ldquo;create post&amp;rdquo; endpoint should receive the title, body, tags and an image to display at the top of the post. This raises a question: how do we send the image? There are at least 3 options:
 Embed the image bytes as base64 in the JSON payload, e.g.  { &amp;#34;title&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;My first blog post&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;body&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;This is going to be the best blog EVER!</description>

      <description>If you have used the HttpWebRequest class to upload data, you know that it uses a “push” model. What I mean is that you call the GetRequestStream method, which opens the connection if necessary, sends the headers, and returns a stream on which you can write directly.
.NET 4.5 introduced the HttpClient class as a new way to communicate over HTTP. It actually relies on HttpWebRequest under the hood, but offers a more convenient and fully asynchronous API.</description>
