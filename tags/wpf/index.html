      Ever since the first stable release of the .NET Core SDK, we&rsquo;ve enjoyed a better C# project format, often called &ldquo;SDK-style&rdquo; because you specify a SDK to use in the project file. It&rsquo;s still a .csproj XML file, it&rsquo;s still based on MSBuild, but it&rsquo;s much more lightweight and much easier to edit by hand. Personally, I love it and use it everywhere I can.
However, out of the box, it&rsquo;s only usable for some project types: ASP.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      WPF’s RichTextBox control is quite powerful, and very handy if you need to accept rich text input. However, one of its features can become an issue: the user can paste an image. Depending on what you intend to do with the text entered by the user, you might not want that.
When I googled for a way to prevent that, the only solutions I found suggested to intercept the Ctrl-V keystroke, and swallow the event if the clipboard contains an image.

      A common requirement for desktop applications is to handle system-wide hotkeys, in order to intercept keyboard shortcuts even when they don’t have focus. Unfortunately, there is no built-in feature in the .NET framework to do it.
Of course, this is not a new issue, and there are quite a few open-source libraries that address it (e.g. VirtualInput). Most of them rely on a global system hook, which allow them to intercept all keystrokes, even the ones you’re not interested in.

These styles are very simple, they&rsquo;re just the default styles of CheckBox and RadioButton in which I only changed the templates to replace the BulletChromes with these awesome blue tick marks.

      It&rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote about markup extensions&hellip; The release of Visual Studio 11 Developer Preview, which introduces a number of new features to WPF, just gave me a reason to play with them again. The feature I&rsquo;m going to discuss here is perhaps not the most impressive, but it fills in a gap of the previous versions: the support of markup extensions for events. Until now, it was possible to use a markup extension in XAML to assign a value to a property, but we couldn&rsquo;t do the same to subscribe to an event.

Actually, the GIF format itself is supported by the imaging API, but the Image control only shows the first frame of the animation. Many solutions to this problem have been proposed on technical forums and blogs, usually variations of the following approaches:

        [WPF] How to bind to data when the DataContext is not inherited
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      The DataContext property in WPF is extremely handy, because it is automatically inherited by all children of the element where you assign it; therefore you don&rsquo;t need to set it again on each element you want to bind. However, in some cases the DataContext is not accessible: it happens for elements that are not part of the visual or logical tree. It can be very difficult then to bind a property on those elements&hellip; Let&rsquo;s illustrate with a simple example: we want to display a list of products in a DataGrid.

      The Grid control is one of the most frequently used containers in WPF. It allows to layout elements easily in rows and columns. Unfortunately the code to declare it, while simple to write, is made quite awkward by the use of the property element syntax:

      THE feature that was missing from WPF ! Visual Studio 2010 beta 2 has been released last week, and it brings to WPF a long awaited feature : support for bindings in InputBindings. As a reminder, the issue in previous releases was that the Command property of the InputBinding class wasn&rsquo;t a DependencyProperty, so it wasn&rsquo;t possible to bind it. Furthermore, InputBindings didn&rsquo;t inherit the parent DataContext, which made it difficult to provide alternative implementations&hellip; Until now, in order to bind the Command of a KeyBinding or MouseBinding to a property of the DataContext, we had to resort to clumsy workarounds&hellip; I had eventually came up with an acceptable solution, described in this post, but I wasn&rsquo;t really satisfied with it (it used reflection on private members, and had annoying limitations).

To achieve this result, I used an Adorner : this is a component which allows to draw over existing UI elements, on an independant rendering layer.

      If you develop WPF applications according to the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, you may have faced this issue : in XAML, how to bind a key or mouse gesture to a ViewModel command ? The obvious and intuitive approach would be this one :
&lt;UserControl.InputBindings&gt; &lt;KeyBinding Modifiers=&#34;Control&#34; Key=&#34;E&#34; Command=&#34;{Binding EditCommand}&#34;/&gt; &lt;/UserControl.InputBindings&gt; Unfortunately, this code doesn&rsquo;t work, for two reasons :
 The Command property is not a dependency property, so you cannot assign it through binding InputBindings are not part of the logical or visual tree of the control, so they don&rsquo;t inherit the DataContext  A solution would be to create the InputBindings in the code-behind, but in the MVVM pattern we usually prefer to avoid this&hellip; I spent a long time looking for alternative solutions to do this in XAML, but most of them are quite complex and unintuitive.

      Soon after the release of WPF, people have been talking more and more about &ldquo;Model-View-ViewModel&rdquo; (MVVM). This expression refers to a design pattern, drawing its inspiration from the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Presentation Model (PM) patterns, and created specifically to take advantage of WPF features. This patterns enables an excellent decoupling between data, behavior and presentation, which makes the code easier to understand and maintain, and improves the collaboration between developers and designers.

      Today, I stumbled upon a very handy class : SyndicationFeed. This class, introduced in .NET 3.5, allows to manipulate syndication feeds (like RSS 2.0 or Atom 1.0) with very little code. It can be used to create and publish our own feeds, or to read existing ones. For instance, here&rsquo;s how to retrieve the news feed from Google News and display its title, its hyperlink, and the titles of it&rsquo;s items :

      Oops&hellip; 2 months already since my previous (and first) post&hellip; I really have to get on a more regular schedule ;)
If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to use the Clipboard.GetImage method in WPF, you probably had an unpleasant surprise&hellip; In fact, this method returns an InteropBitmap which, in some cases (most cases actually), can&rsquo;t be displayed in an Image control : no exception is thrown, the image size is correct, but the image either appears empty or unrecognizable.

      Hi, this is my first post on this blog, I hope you will enjoy it ;-). If you want to know a few things about me, please check out this page.
The end-user of any application expects that his preferences (window size, state of this or that option&hellip;) are saved to be restored at the next run : that&rsquo;s why .NET 2.0 introduced application settings as a unified way to persist these settings.
