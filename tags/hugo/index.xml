      <description>If you&#39;re a regular reader of my blog, you probably noticed that the design has changed. In fact, it&#39;s not just the design, it&#39;s just about everything!
My blog used to be hosted on WordPress. It did the job, but honestly, I didn&#39;t really like WordPress. It&#39;s slow, bloated, and the editing and publishing experience is a bit of a mess (or at least, it&#39;s not a good fit for the way I like to work).</description>
